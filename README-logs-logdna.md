## Step 3 - Filter logs for a specific container

You can filter logs by tags, sources, containers or levels.
    * Tags: related to IKS clusters
    * Sources: related to IKS pods
    * Containers: related to IKS containers. Since one containers typically runs one microservice per cloud native development best practice, each container should repsent one microservice. For example, `customers` container represents `customers` service component.
    * Levels: related to log level, for example error or debug.

1. On LogDNA UI, select `EVERYTHING` in the top-left corner to clear the searching criteria and restore all log entries.

    !["access_iks_cluster"](doc/images/logdna06.png)

1. Select `Tags` dropdown list on the top. You can filter log entries related to a single cluster or a set of clusters. For this exercise, you don't have to change anything.

1. Select `Sources` dropdown list, you may filter log entries related to one Kubernetes pod or a set of pods. For this exercise, you don't have to change anything.

1. Select `Apps` dropdown list, you may filter log entries related to one Kubernetes container or a set of containers. 

1. Select `Customers` checkbox under the `Containers` section and `Apply`. Now, you see log entries for `Customers` service component only. Most of the entries are for `DEBUG` purpose.

    !["access_iks_cluster"](doc/images/logdna12.png)

1. Select `Levels` dropdown list, you may filter log entries related to one log level or a set of log levels.

1. Select everything except `DEBUG` log level and `Apply`. 

1. You may see no log entry or a few lines of log entries, depend on your log entries.


## Step 4 - Create a new view

You may create a new view to save your current filter.

1. Click `Unsaved View` on the LogDNA UI and select `Save as new view`.

1. In the `Name` field, enter `My CUSTOMERS service component`.

1. Select `Save View`.
